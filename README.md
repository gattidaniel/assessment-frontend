As a insurance company we've been asked to develop an application that manages some information about our insurance policies and company clients. To do that, we need to create a cool website that shows the list of clients, and allows us to view the policies linked to a selected client. Only users that are included in the list, can access the application.

We have the following constraints: 
* Website should be developed using Angular/Knockout. 
* CSS is required 
* Typescript is required 
* The JSON list of policies can be collected from: http://www.mocky.io/v2/580891a4100000e8242b75c5 
* The JSON list of users can be collected from: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5808862710000087232b75ac 
* The list cannot be accessed without previous authentication (check client's email)

As our stakeholders are very fussy, here some tips: 
* Usage of last technologies 
* Solution properly structured 
* Usage of patterns
